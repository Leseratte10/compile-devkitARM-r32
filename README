# devkitARM r32

devkitARM r32 is needed for lots of ARM applications, including compiling new cIOS or other IOS-related applications. 

The original binaries for devkitARM r32 cannot be downloaded anymore 
(except for the Windows build from my archive at https://wii.leseratte10.de), 
thus I am providing this Dockerfile that downloads the necessary sources from my archive
and then compiles a working devkitARM r32 for Linux.
