# devkitARM r32

devkitARM r32 is needed for lots of ARM applications, including compiling new cIOS or other IOS-related applications. 

The original binaries for devkitARM r32 cannot be downloaded anymore 
(except for the Windows build from my archive at https://wii.leseratte10.de), 
thus I am providing these Dockerfiles that run on Debian squeeze, Debian buster, 
Ubuntu Bionic, Ubuntu Focal and Ubuntu Groovy (and probably on other versions, too, if you modify them a bit). 
The Dockerfiles then compile a working devkitARM r32 for that particular distribution. 

Check out this [wiki page](https://github.com/Leseratte10/compile-devkitARM-r32/wiki/Compiling) if you want to compile devkitARM r32 yourself.
